# Hospital-Management-System
Hospital Management System is a backend-driven healthcare application developed using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.2, designed to simulate a real-world enterprise hospital management environment. The system enables secure management of patients, doctors, and administrators through role-based authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT. It incorporates BCrypt password encryption to ensure data security and follows a clean layered architecture consisting of controller, service, repository, DTO, and exception handling layers. The application supports patient and doctor registration, login functionality, doctor profile management, and structured availability scheduling with time-slot validation to prevent overlaps. Dynamic filtering and pagination mechanisms are implemented for efficient doctor listing and administrative operations. The project uses Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for ORM-based database interaction with PostgreSQL. Input validation is handled using Spring Validation, and centralized exception handling ensures consistent API responses. API documentation is integrated using Swagger (OpenAPI) for better usability and testing. The project was built and tested using Maven, Postman, and Git, demonstrating strong understanding of REST API development, secure backend architecture, database modeling, and enterprise-level application design principles.
